# 🏆 Data Science Hackathon - Inventory Prediction

## 📌 Description
This repository contains all the content generated during a data science hackathon, where we developed a model to predict the inventory of a lubricant company. Here you will find the code, reports, and analyses conducted during the event.

## 🚀 Project Objective
The goal was to develop a prediction model to optimize the company's inventory management.

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Data cleaning and visualization.
2. **Model Selection**: Evaluation of different machine learning algorithms.
4. **Training and Evaluation**: Model optimization and metric analysis.
5. **Conclusions and Recommendations**.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Models (MA,ARIMA,SARIMA)
- Git/GitHub for version control
